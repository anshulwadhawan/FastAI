rather than being punished for linking another site, by handing over the user s attention, tagging links with utag captures that value in real money without any cost to the linker or linkee. utag provides a true reflection of the value created by linking to another site.

utag was created by a group of five sydney entrepreneurs during, amazingly, a 48hr entrepreneur  exercise  event call startup camp. the team was one of three working and coding tyrelessly with little sleep for the duration of the weekend event in a borrowed board room overlooking sydney harbour.

utag has two implementation methods. for websites and platforms, site-wide implementation takes less than 2 minutes, costs nothing and requires no commitment. there is also an api for developers. the second implementation method is tag a single url for individuals to use in twitter posts, blog and forum comments and when the java script method is not an option.
